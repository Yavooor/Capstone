Successful Deployment
The Docker container is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster
The cluster is deployed with CloudFormation or Ansible. This should be in the source code of the studentâ€™s submission.

**Kubes job in config.yml**

Use Blue/Green Deployment or a Rolling Deployment successfully
The project performs the correct steps to do a blue/green or a rolling deployment into the environment selected. Student demonstrates the successful completion of chosen deployment methodology with screenshots.

**Didn't have time to implement this last one, the idea was to have a rolling one**
